Dear Hiring Manager,
I am excited to apply for an internship at Salesforce. As a Computer Science and Chemistry student at the University of Michigan, I am passionate about building impactful technology solutions, and I admire Salesforce’s leadership in driving innovation and empowering businesses through its customer-focused ecosystem.
This past summer, I interned at Cove.ai, where I contributed to enhancing generative AI workflows by implementing techniques like Chain of Thought reasoning and Retrieval-Augmented Generation. I also developed tools to evaluate AI performance across multiple providers, gaining experience in designing scalable and user-friendly systems. These projects deepened my appreciation for creating seamless solutions that improve user experiences—an approach central to Salesforce’s mission of customer success.
I am particularly eager to contribute to projects that optimize Salesforce’s tools for scalability and efficiency while continuing to grow my technical expertise in platforms like Einstein AI and Slack integrations. With a strong foundation in Python, full-stack development, and a passion for problem-solving, I am excited about the opportunity to support Salesforce’s efforts to redefine business productivity.
Thank you for considering my application. I would be thrilled to bring my skills and enthusiasm to Salesforce and contribute meaningfully to your innovative projects.
Best regards,

Dear Hiring Manager,
I hope this message finds you well. I am excited to apply for an internship at Hugging Face. As a Computer Science student at the University of Michigan, I am passionate about machine learning and AI, and I am eager to contribute to your mission of democratizing AI while growing my expertise in the field.
This past summer, I interned at Cove.ai, where I gained experience optimizing generative AI workflows using techniques like Chain of Thought reasoning and Retrieval-Augmented Generation. I also developed tools to evaluate model performance across providers, which sparked my interest in the challenges of deploying models on diverse hardware platforms. While I have foundational experience with machine learning frameworks like Transformers, I am actively working to deepen my understanding of hardware optimization and user-friendly design for tools like Hugging Face’s Optimum, as I see this as a tool that could be helpful beyond the summer.
The opportunity to develop online tools, write deployment guides, and design seamless user flows for Hugging Face models excites me. I am particularly interested in conducting inference experiments to identify optimal hardware backends, as I see this as a critical step in making AI more accessible and efficient. Communicating insights through clear documentation and advocacy is something I’m enthusiastic about and eager to refine further. I have experience writing documentation, and would love to share my work if given the opportunity.
Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to contribute to Hugging Face’s innovative projects while learning from your talented team.

I am excited to apply for the Software Engineer Intern position at Pure Storage. As a Computer Science student at the University of Michigan with a strong foundation in programming and problem-solving, I am eager to contribute to impactful projects that redefine data storage and management. The opportunity to collaborate on a unique, challenging project that aligns with my background while expanding my technical skillset excites me, and I am particularly drawn to Pure’s emphasis on fostering professional development through meaningful intern experiences.
During my internship at Cove.ai, I developed scalable systems for optimizing generative AI workflows and tools for comparative analysis across providers. This experience sharpened my skills in Python and system design while giving me an appreciation for balancing performance and user experience. However, my interests go beyond AI—I am equally motivated to deepen my expertise in C++ and explore challenges related to operating systems and enterprise-scale infrastructure, areas central to Pure’s innovative products like FlashArray and Portworx.
I take pride in delivering high-quality results independently and collaboratively, and I value the opportunity to immerse myself in Pure’s dynamic, office-centric team environment. I am particularly excited about working on a project that not only enhances my technical abilities but also contributes meaningfully to Pure Storage’s mission of revolutionizing data management.
Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to bring my passion for problem-solving and growth mindset to Pure Storage’s team and make a meaningful impact during the internship.

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to express my strong interest in joining OpenAI as an Applied AI Software Intern. As a Computer Science student at the University of Michigan, I am passionate about machine learning and artificial intelligence, and I am excited by the opportunity to contribute to your innovative organization.
This past summer, I interned at the start-up Cove.ai, where I gained hands-on experience in full-stack development and machine learning applications. I worked on implementing techniques such as function calling and structured outputs in JSON for a pseudo-agentic workflow. Additionally, I engineered prompts utilizing CoT reasoning and RAG to improve the quality of AI-generated responses. I also developed a tool for testing and comparing AI responses across different large LLM providers. These projects helped me deepen my understanding of the practical challenges involved in building advanced AI systems.
I am eager to further expand my knowledge of AI and to contribute meaningfully to your team. Thank you for considering my application, and I would love the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to OpenAI's mission.
