### What to do
- Focus on **showing value**, not expressing enthusiasm — lead with what you can contribute.
- Highlight **specific, measurable impact** from past work (e.g., reliability ↑, latency ↓, hours saved).
- Make the letter **role- and company-specific** by referencing a concrete product, technical area, or challenge the team works on.
- Keep the content **concise and scannable** — aim for ~150–220 words with short paragraphs or a small bullet section.
- Emphasize **engineering maturity**: testing discipline, documentation, debugging approach, design reasoning, and how you improve systems.
- Use **clear, direct language** with action verbs — avoid vague or emotional phrasing.
- Treat the letter as **context and interpretation** of your résumé, not a restatement of it.
- Close with a confident, **forward-looking invitation**, not a request for approval.

### Pitfalls to Avoid
- Don’t list every project or tool — **select only what maps directly** to the role.
- Don’t rely on **generic admiration** of the company — specificity signals authenticity.
- Don’t turn the letter into a **personal narrative** about your journey into CS.
- Don’t use **overly eager or apologetic** language — aim for calm, competent, and factual.
