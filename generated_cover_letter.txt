Dear Hiring Manager,

As a computer science student specializing in data science and algorithms, my work at Cove.ai and Adeptia has honed my ability to build scalable, user-friendly applications and systems. My knack for improving efficiency and accuracy in high-stakes environments aligns with New Constructs' commitment to providing the most accurate risk/reward assessments. With hands-on experience in deploying automated workflows and reducing manual review by 10 hours per week, I am confident that I can contribute effectively to your data-driven investment research projects.

At the University of Michigan, I developed a keen interest in the intersection of finance and technology, which led me to New Constructs. I am particularly captivated by your unique forensic accounting methods and your dedication to unearthing hidden details in financial filings. The opportunity to contribute my technical skills to a firm that is revolutionizing the investment research landscape is immensely exciting. I would be thrilled to discuss how my experience with Python, SQL, and ML/AI algorithms can support your mission of illuminating investment truths and empowering clients to make informed decisions.

Best regards,
Justin Chu
