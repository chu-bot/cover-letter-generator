Work Experience
Full Stack + UI Design Intern Summer 2025
Adeptia Remote
• Deployed an automated customer churn workflow (Python, OpenAI function-calling, MySQL) with explainable risk
write-ups, a dedicated front-end, and audit logs, reducing manual review by ten hours per week.
• Launched an internal portal reaching 300 workers with a spreadsheet-driven CMS and lightweight automation,
enabling non-technical staff to update content directly and lowering median time to find documentation for
customer-facing teams.
• Designed modular case-study tiles, filters, and search for self-serve composition by editors, improving customer
website retention rate by 24%.
Machine Learning + Full Stack Intern Summer 2024
Cove, Inc. (Cove.ai) Menlo Park, CA
• Developed an end-to-end feature (React, Python) that surfaces context-aware suggestions from user text and
images, becoming a core part of customer workflows within six weeks.
• Built a commit-time testing framework (Playwright, LangSmith) that gates front-end changes and prompt updates
in production, processing ˜30 commits/day to uphold release reliability and scalability.
• Improved response quality and consistency in GPT-4 and Claude 3 Sonnet by applying CoT (pre-native reasoning)
and optimizing RAG, cutting JSON schema/parsing errors by ˜90%.
Machine Learning Research Assistant Summer 2023
University of Michigan, Department of Medicine (Dr. Shaomeng Wang’s Lab) Ann Arbor, MI
• Trained and evaluated XGBoost models to predict oral potency of small-molecule degraders, achieving a net 82%
accuracy on held-out sets.
• Performed model tuning, k-fold cross-validation, and SHAP-based interpretability analysis to evaluate robustness
and extract chemically meaningful structure–activity trends.
Project Experience
DnD Text Adventure | Python, OpenAI API
• Built a Python adventure engine on the OpenAI API with a mixture-of-experts design that routes player intents to
specialized agents (conversation, combat, environment) with tailored prompts and tool calls.
• Added a rules core with feasibility gating to validate intents before generation, keeping narrative coherent and
preventing invalid branches.
• Fine-tuned a DeepSeek-derived rules model to enforce world logic, maintaining consistent, canon-aligned
playthroughs.
Full-Stack Media Feed | React, TypeScript, Python, AWS
• Built an authenticated React/TypeScript single-page app with a Python REST API exposing feed, likes, and
comments, using cursor-based pagination and optimistic updates to keep interactions responsive.
• Structured the API with clear request/response schemas and input validation, added JWT authentication with
refresh rotation, and wrote unit and request tests to guard critical paths.
